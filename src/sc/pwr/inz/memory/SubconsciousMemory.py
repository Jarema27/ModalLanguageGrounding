#   Jacques Lacan in his psychoanalytical theory compared the structuring of the unconscious to the way a language

# This suggests that unconscious influence on thought processes could be altered after traumatic brain injury.
#   This theory could explain the cases of altered personality, like Phineas Gage,
#  due to trauma or traumatic brain injury.
